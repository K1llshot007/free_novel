# free_novel
I want to build a website(at least in the beginning), or a place where people who like to read web novels but cant do that because of the paywalls in apps like WebNovels, or the lazy updates and adds of the pirated sites irritate them, come together to make a youtube like place for creators to show off their writing skills.
