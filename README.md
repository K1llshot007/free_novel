# free_novel
I want to build a website(at least in the beginning), or a place where people who like to read web novels but cant do that because of the paywalls in apps like WebNovels, or the lazy updates and ads of the pirated sites irritate them, come together to make a youtube like place for creators to show off their writing skills. This place will have a subscription model like twitch/youtube so someone who wants to support the writer can do so, I also really like the privilege option in WebNovel that allows for early access, this will also be included, I want the revenue share to be creator sided, and its a public repo, whoever contributes thanks, if it takes off you are welcome to join the company and work to help people read. 
Well i am a coder first so more details on revenue share later first lets at least make the front end of this thing.
